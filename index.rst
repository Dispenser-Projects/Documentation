🔎 What is it?
--------------

Dispenser API is an API to provide Minecraft resources through a REST API. Is considered as "resources" all files that isn't a compiled Java class, so assets (client-side) and data (server-side).

This API is updated automatically (every hours) and work for any Minecraft version (release, release-candidate, pre-release, snapshot) having the considered resource type.

A hosting version of the API is available here. Thanks to Gunivers for supporting and hosting this project!
